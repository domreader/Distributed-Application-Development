# Distributed-Application-Development
This the is repository for university module SOFT355 which involves creating a full client and server stack website.

To use there are a few steps :

- Download and extract the zip then open in an IDE
- Next install Node if needed.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the Menu Maestro folder
- Open another terminal and navigate to the bin folder for mongoDB and run mongod.exe

- Next use the following commands if needed to install packages
	- npm install Express
	- npm install socket.io
	- npm install Mongoose 
	- npm install body-parser

After these are all installed if you type in
	- node server.js 
The project should run - However you may need to create a folder on the C root directory called data then inside one called db

Now go to http://localhost:9000/index - The site will work :)
